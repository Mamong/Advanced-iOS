## The language of motion 运动术语
Direction 方向
scalar标量（只有数值），vector向量（既有数值又有方向）
Distance路程，距离（标量），
position位置（向量）
displacement位移（向量）from a fixed origin
Diagrams and graphs示意图和图表
Notation and units记号和单位
● s, h, x, y and z for position
● t for time measured from a starting instant
● u and v for velocity
● a for acceleration.
distance is the metre (m), that for time is the second (s) and that for mass the kilogram (kg)

## Speed and velocity 速率和速度
position–time graph
Velocity is represented by the gradient（斜率） of the position–time graph.
rate of change of position

Distance–time graph
Speed is represented by the gradient of the distance–time graph.
magnitude of velocity

velocity–time graph
speed–time graph

Average speed and average velocity
average speed = total distance travelled/ total time taken
average velocity = displacement/ time taken

Velocity at an instant


## Acceleration加速度
average acceleration = change in velocity/timetaken
Acceleration is represented by the gradient of a velocity–time graph
rate of change of velocity

The sign of acceleration加速度的方向

Estimating areas
## Using areas to find distances and displacements使用区域计算距离和位移
The area between a speed–time graph and the time axis represents the distance travelled.

Finding the area under speed–time graphs
Triangle,Rectangle,trapezium

The area between a velocity–time graph and the time axis represents the change in position, that is the displacement.

Estimating areas
Sometimes the velocity–time graph does not consist of straight lines so you have to make the best estimate you can by counting the squares underneath it or by replacing the curve by a number of straight lines as for the trapezium rule
